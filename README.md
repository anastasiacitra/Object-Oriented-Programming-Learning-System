Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Objects represent real-world entities with attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). OOP aims to enhance code reusability, scalability, and maintainability by encapsulating related properties and functions into objects.
